# Node.js Mentorship Program

### I am passionate about programming, I'm committing code to my github daily. I am hungry to learn as much as I can about the node.js ecosystem.

### This program will benefit me because I have been searching for guidance in furthering my knowledge of node. And I believe I can benefit the program by being willing to learn, ready to contribute, and impeccable communication skills.

### Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.
